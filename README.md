# How to Build an LLM Evaluation Framework from Scratch

## Introduction

In this guide, we will explore how to build an LLM evaluation framework to systematically identify the best hyperparameters for your LLM systems. This framework will help you determine whether to use newly released models or which prompt templates to employ.

## What is an LLM Evaluation Framework?

An LLM evaluation framework is a software package designed to evaluate and test outputs of LLM systems on various criteria. The performance of an LLM system is quantified by LLM evaluation metrics, which use different scoring methods depending on the task at hand. This process is known as LLM system evaluation.

### Key Components

1. **LLM Test Cases**: A set of LLM input-output pairs, the "evaluatee".
2. **LLM Evaluation Metrics**: Quantify the assessment criteria, the "evaluator".

## Challenges in Building an LLM Evaluation Framework

1. **LLM Evaluation Metrics**: Making them accurate and reliable is challenging.
2. **Evaluation Datasets/Test Cases**: Creating comprehensive datasets is time-consuming.

## Step-By-Step Guide: Building an LLM Evaluation Framework

### 1. Framework Setup

Set up the infrastructure needed for evaluation. The "evaluatee" is an LLM test case, and the "evaluator" is the LLM evaluation metrics.

### 2. Implement LLM Evaluation Metrics

Implement metrics to test various aspects of LLM systems, such as contextual relevancy.

### 3. Implement Synthetic Data Generator

Generate synthetic data to create LLM test cases, which can be more accessible than creating datasets from scratch.

### 4. Optimize for Speed

Make metrics run asynchronously to handle large datasets efficiently.

### 5. Caching Results and Error Handling

Implement caching to avoid rerunning test cases unnecessarily and handle errors gracefully.

### 6. Logging Hyperparameters

Associate hyperparameters with evaluation results to determine optimal configurations.

### 7. CI/CD Integration

Integrate the framework into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.

## Conclusion

Building an LLM evaluation framework is a complex task, but it is essential for optimizing LLM systems. For a robust solution, consider using DeepEval, an open-source LLM evaluation framework with extensive features.
